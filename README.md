# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.
The goal is to analyze passenger data and identify patterns affecting survival.

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:

- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Fare
- Embarked

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Dropped `Cabin` column due to high missing values
- Filled missing `Age` values with mean
- Filled missing `Fare` values with mean

---

## 📈 Analysis Performed
- Survival Rate Calculation
- Survival by Sex
- Survival by Passenger Class
- Survival by Age Distribution
- Fare Distribution
- Correlation Heatmap

---

## 📷 Visualizations
The project includes:

- Barplots
- Histograms
- Heatmap

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate
- First-class passengers survived more frequently
- Fare and class showed correlation with survival
